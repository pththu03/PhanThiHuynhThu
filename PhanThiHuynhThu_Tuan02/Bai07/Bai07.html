        <p>A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, an action known as
            a "Duchenne smile" Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.</p>
